Reference Microsoft and industry guidelines for professional appearance.\n\n2. **openpyxl Formatting Implementation:**\n   - Use openpyxl's `styles` module to apply formatting: set bold fonts for headers, center alignment, and appropriate background fills for header rows.\n   - Apply borders (thin, solid) to all data cells and headers for clear separation.\n   - Ensure column widths are auto-adjusted for content readability.\n   - Implement conditional formatting for business-relevant patterns (e.g., highlight negative values in red, totals in bold or with background fill)[2][4].\n   - Validate that all formatting is preserved when files are opened in Excel.\n\n3. **XlsxWriter Formatting Implementation:**\n   - Use XlsxWriter's `add_format` and `write_rich_string` methods to apply rich formatting to headers and data cells[3].\n   - Ensure consistent formatting logic between openpyxl and XlsxWriter outputs.\n   - Document any differences in formatting capabilities or limitations between the two libraries.\n\n4. **Validation Patterns:**\n   - Develop reusable validation functions to check for required formatting: header font, alignment, border presence, background color, and column width.\n   - Implement automated checks using openpyxl to read back generated files and assert formatting compliance.\n   - Ensure all output meets accessibility and readability standards for business users.\n\n5. **Documentation:**\n   - Document all formatting rules, code patterns, and validation logic for future maintainability.\n   - Provide code examples for both openpyxl and XlsxWriter demonstrating best practices for professional business output formatting.\n\n6. **Context7 Patterns:**\n   - Align implementation with Context7 validation and output patterns as referenced in prior tasks.\n\n**Example (openpyxl):**\n```python\nfrom openpyxl.styles import Font, Alignment, Border, Side, PatternFill\nheader_font = Font(bold=True, name='Calibri', size=11)\nheader_fill = PatternFill(start_color='FFD700', end_color='FFD700', fill_type='solid')\nheader_alignment = Alignment(horizontal='center', vertical='center')\nthin_border = Border(left=Side(style='thin'), right=Side(style='thin'), top=Side(style='thin'), bottom=Side(style='thin'))\nfor cell in sheet[1]:\n    cell.font = header_font\n    cell.fill = header_fill\n    cell.alignment = header_alignment\n    cell.border = thin_border\n```\n\n**Example (XlsxWriter):**\n```python\nheader_format = workbook.add_format({'bold': True, 'font_name': 'Calibri', 'font_size': 11, 'align': 'center', 'bg_color': '#FFD700', 'border': 1})\nworksheet.write('A1', 'Header', header_format)\n```\n",

Scenarios should include varying dataset sizes (e.g., 10K, 100K, 1M rows), different data types (numeric, text, mixed), and representative business data patterns.\n\n2. **Implementation:**\n   - Develop scripts to generate synthetic datasets of increasing size and complexity.\n   - Implement export routines using both openpyxl and XlsxWriter, ensuring consistent data and formatting across libraries.\n   - Integrate memory monitoring (e.g., using psutil) and precise timing (e.g., time.perf_counter) to capture peak memory usage and export duration for each test run.\n   - Record resulting file sizes and validate file integrity (openability, data correctness) post-export.\n\n3. **Performance Metrics:**\n   - Capture and log: export time, peak memory usage, resulting file size, and any errors or failures (e.g., out-of-memory, file corruption).\n   - Identify file size and row count thresholds where performance degrades or failures occur.\n   - Compare openpyxl and XlsxWriter results, noting strengths and weaknesses for each library.\n\n4. **Reporting:**\n   - Summarize results in tabular and graphical form (e.g., CSV/Excel summary, matplotlib charts).\n   - Document best practices for optimizing export performance and memory usage, including batching, streaming, and library-specific options.\n   - Provide actionable recommendations for handling large dataset exports in production.\n\n5. **Context7 Patterns:**\n   - Follow Context7 code organization and documentation standards for reproducibility and maintainability.\n   - Ensure all scripts and results are version-controlled and reproducible.",
