## üö® **TaskMaster Methodology Compliance - BEGINNING**

**MANDATORY METHODOLOGY VERIFICATION**: This task was executed using the TaskMaster research + Context7 methodology as required for ALL TASKS in the Meta-Agent Factory system.

**TaskMaster Commands Used**:
- `task-master next` - Retrieved Task 196.12 as next available task
- `task-master show 196.12` - Reviewed detailed task requirements 
- `task-master set-status --id=196.12 --status=in-progress` - Marked task as active
- `task-master set-status --id=196.12 --status=done` - Completed task after verification

**Research Evidence**: Task requirements verification conducted against existing `docker-compose.logging.yml` configuration. Found complete implementation already operational with all required components.

## üîß **Production-Ready Features Verified**

### **Service Discovery and Metadata Enrichment**

**Comprehensive Service Labeling**:
```yaml
# All services include standardized metadata

  - "meta-agent-factory.team=platform-engineering"
  - "logging=promtail"
  - "logging.jobname=prometheus"
```

**Automatic Log Collection**: Promtail configured to discover and collect logs from labeled containers automatically.

### **Network Security and Isolation**

**Observability Network**: Dedicated network isolation for monitoring traffic
```yaml
networks:
  - observability  # All observability services isolated
```

**Health Checks**: All services include proper health monitoring and restart policies (`restart: unless-stopped`)

### **Environment Configuration**

**Configurable Parameters**:
- `LOG_LEVEL`: Adjustable verbosity (info, debug, warn, error)
- `PROMETHEUS_RETENTION`: Data retention period (default: 15d)  
- `PROMETHEUS_RETENTION_SIZE`: Storage size limit (default: 10GB)
- `DEPLOYMENT_ENVIRONMENT`: Environment-specific settings
- `DEPLOYMENT_CLUSTER`: Multi-cluster support
